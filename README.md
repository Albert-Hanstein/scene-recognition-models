# scene-recognition-models
Two Machine Learning and one Deep Learning technique for Scene Recognition

This is a project a friend and I started to practice our Computer Vision skills.

Run 1 consists of classification using K-Nearest Neighbours.

Run 2 makes use of a Bag of Visual Words from images, K-Means Clustering and One-vs-All Classification.

Run 3 uses a Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
